# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer:
  
  Props in React is short for properties. Properties can be passed to multiple components.

  Researched answer:
  
  Props, or properties, are arguments passed that are passed into React components. They are passed to components via html attributes. Props are also how data is passed from one component to another. That said, props can not be changed, as they are read only.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer:

  A DOM event is something like an onClick, that signal for JS code to execute. 

  Researched answer:

  DOM events can be triggered by interactions with the UI and signal that something has happened. DOM events are triggered by "listeners" that wait for said interactions with the UI. 



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer:

  Object oriented programming is programming based off of every day life. It deals with classes and objects, whereas functional programming deals with the evaluations of functions. 

  Researched answer:

OOP or object oriented programming is programming that uses objects to represent things, similar to everyday life. The object will hold data about themselves in attributes. It differs from functional programming in that functional programming uses immutable data (OOP uses mutable data), meaning it can't be changed, and it emphasizes on the evaluation of functions. 




4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer:

  The difference between a float and an integer is that a float is an integer that contains a decimal. When it comes to evaluating integers, if we want to see a float, let's say in a division problem, one of the numbers of the equation must be a float. ex: 55/10 will return an integer where 55/10.0 will return a float.

  Researched answer:

  Integers in Ruby are whole numbers that are positive, negative, as well as 0. Floats, or floating point numbers in Ruby represent real numbers, that can be either rational or irrational. Floats contain a decimal point, or fractional part, which makes them different from integers. 



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer:

  Implicit return means that there is no need to use a 'return' command in Ruby. 

  Researched answer:

Ruby has an implicit return, meaning that any statement in ruby returns the value of the last evaluated expression/
